My log———>>>>>>>


rabbitMQ was not installed correctly, users were not added properly. 
>>>> added users again, according to the confluence doc

Some certificate error, wouldn’t let me login to my health app
>>>>> installed the certificate to the desired directory.

Wasn’t able to open localdev.stanfordhealthcare.org, because tomcat couldn’t read my root.xml from Catalina dir, root.xml point the server to start from target folder project,
>>>>>>syntax of the root.xml wasn’t correct.

Compass had issues, ruby couldn’t find it, don’t know why I installed it earlier.
Error: While executing gem ... (Errno::EPERM)
    Operation not permitted - /usr/bin/sass
Because this man verify was also failing as the grunt test were not going through.
>>>>>>>>>>>installed ruby, compass through brew.
Brew install ruby 
sudo Gem install compass

Tried to achieve live reload using gulp, when I installed node modules, like gulp-reload, gulp-compass(was not working as compass was not found, while trying to compile sass files it encountered error while executing @import compass) my git has many files to be committed (changed) turns out some one checked in a node module grunt-usemin something like this, which should not be done as node packages should only be installed through package.json. removed the grunt-usein from repository


Grunt unit:test doesn’t work. Grunt unit task calls karma test file.
>>>>>> updated the versions of grunt-karma and karma modules and it worked.. 


RSYNC doesn’t work on tomcat due to permissions, you have to sudo everytime, dealing eith rigel it was giving me hard time whenever I was trying to rsync the changes from rigel source code to tomcat rigel folder.

Solution: run rigel from the dev-current war rather than deploying a rigel war directly to tomcat. Just like we are doing it for orionweb, created a Rigel.war in tomcat conf same as I created ROOT.xml for orionweb.
